ftdi-flash-tool
===============

This is an alternative to the libftdi flash tool, which seems to be missing functionality 
and in some cases can produce broken configurations.

There is also a rudimentary tool to take an FTDI xml configuration and convert it to an
ftdi-flash-tool-style configuration file, which is compatible with ftdi_eeprom as well.
